    "Most of human and animal learning is unsupervised learning. If intelligence was a cake, unsupervised learning would be the cake, supervised learning would be the icing on the cake, and reinforcement learning would be the cherry on the cake. We know how to make the icing and the cherry, but we don’t know how to make the cake. We need to solve the unsupervised learning problem before we can even think of getting to true AI.\n",

    "* the AI trains on the training data (experience) to improve its error rate (performance) in flagging spam (task), and the ultimate success criterion is how well its experience generalizes to new, never-before-seen data (generalization error).\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could also use machine learning systems as an exploration or data discovery tool to gain deeper insight into the problem we are trying to solve. For example, in the email spam filter example, we can learn which words or phrases are most predictive of spam and recognize newly emerging malicious spam patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because the problem does not have a strictly defined task, the AI agent may find interesting patterns above and beyond what we initially were looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [...] unsupervised system is better than the supervised system at finding new patterns in future data[...]\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since the majority of the world’s data is unlabeled, with supervised learning, the ability of AI to expand its performance to never-before-seen instances is quite limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, for problems where patterns are unknown or constantly changing or for which we do not have sufficiently large labeled datasets, unsupervised learning truly shines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* I think AI is akin to building a rocket ship. You need a huge engine and a lot of fuel. If you have a large engine and a tiny amount of fuel, you won’t make it to orbit. If you have a tiny engine and a ton of fuel, you can’t even lift off. To build a rocket you need a huge engine and a lot of fuel. - Andrew Ng\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [...] we can introduce unsupervised learning as a regularizer. Regularization is a process used to reduce the complexity of a machine learning algorithm, helping it capture the signal in the data without adjusting too much to the noise. Unsupervised pretraining is one such form of regularization. Instead of feeding the original input data directly into a supervised learning algorithm, we can feed a new representation of the original input data that we generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even with the advances in computational power, big data is hard for machine learning algorithms to manage. In general, adding more instances is not too problematic because we can parallelize operations using modern map-reduce solutions such as Spark,the more features we have, the more difficult training becomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the features are very numerous, this search becomes very expensive, both from a time and compute perspective. [...] This problem is known as the curse of dimensionality, and unsupervised learning is well suited to help manage this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* With unsupervised learning, we can perform outlier detection using dimensionality reduction and create a solution specifically for the outliers and, separately, a solution for the normal data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* what we care about most is how well the machine learning solution generalizes to never-before-seen cases. The choice of the supervised learning algorithm is very important at minimizing this generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Linear Regression</h1>\n",
    "* If the true relationship between the inputs and the output is linear and the input variables are not highly correlated (a situation known as collinearity), linear regression may be an appropriate choice. If the true relationship is more complex or nonlinear, linear regression will underfit the data.4\n",
